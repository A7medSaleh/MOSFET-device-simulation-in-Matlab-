The metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) is a type of field-effect transistor (FET), most commonly fabricated by the controlled oxidation of silicon. It has an insulated gate, whose voltage determines the conductivity of the device. This ability to change conductivity with the amount of applied voltage can be used for amplifying or switching electronic signals.

I make an accurate modeling for the device on Matlab to study its behavior from different prospective, The properties of the device is first set in the parameters section then the relation between device output with the applied voltages is investigated and shown at the end.

This code has many models implemented and coded to be used in investigating the Mosfet behavior.
